library for making no-code Angular applications.\nUI Builder is an Angular library that lets you transform an application with a static layout and fixed configuration into an application that can be easily reshaped and reconfigured by an end-user, without writing code.\nPrinciple\nA normal Angular application has HTML templates that look like this:\n\n    {{product.name}}\n    \n    {{product.description}}\n    \n        EUR {{product.price}}\n        Add to basket\n    \nThis template is fine, but it is static. If you need to change the layout, or change the price currency from \"EUR\" to \"USD\", then you need a developer to modify the app and rebuild it.\nWhat if the developer could transform the app into a set of modular building blocks, and let the users do what they want, with the simplicity of drag & drop and configuration forms?\nWith UI Builder, this can be achieved with the following steps:\n\nReplace the above template with a \"zone\", including the sub-templates that users will drag & drop and configure.\nDefine your default layout with configuration.\nInsert a configurator, with optional configurators for each sub-template\n\n1) Create a zone\nA zone is defined like this:\n\n\n    \n    \n        {{data.name}}\n    \n\n    \n    \n        {{data.description}}\n    \n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n        {{config.currency}} {{product.price}}\n        Add to basket\n    \n    \nWe pass a list of templates to the zone by transclusion. These templates are just regular Angular templates. They may include one or multiple Angular components, or just plain HTML. Notice that these templates have 2 inputs: data and config. data corresponds to variable data (such as the product price displayed in this example). config corresponds to any other parameter that does not depend on the data (like the price currency).\n2) Define a default layout\nThe zone defined above will display components according to a given configuration. This configuration should be initialized when the application starts.\nIn order to display one of the templates defined above, the configuration must include:\n\nA configuration object for that template\nA \"container\" that references that template\n\nEvery \"zone\" should have a \"container\" configuration corresponding to the \"root\" of these HTML elements:\nzone \"products\"\n|_ container \"products\"\n  |_ template \"name\"\n  |_ template \"description\"\n  |_ template \"image\"\n  |_ template \"price\"Note that this structure can be hierachical, as containers can include other containers.\nThis arborescence of configuration is defined like this:\nimport {Component, OnInit} from '@angular/core';\nimport {ConfigService} from 'ngx-ui-builder';\n\nexport class MyComponent implements OnInit {\n\n    constructor(\n        public configService: ConfigService\n    ){}\n\n    ngOnInit() {\n        this.configService.init([{\n            id: 'products',\n            type: '_container',\n            items: ['name', 'description', 'image', 'price']\n        },{\n            id: 'price',\n            type: 'price',\n            currency: 'EUR'\n        }]);\n    }\n}Notice that:\n\nEach configuration object is passed to the template, hence why it is possible to use the parameters with bindings like this: {{config.currency}}\nIt is possible to omit a trivial configuration object, if it does not have any configuration, like the \"name\", \"description\" and \"image\" templates. The library automatically creates a {id: 'name', type: 'name'} object\nThere is no obligation to have an equal id and type. In fact, the same template can be displayed multiple times, with different input configurations. The only constraint is that id must be unique, and type must refer to a template name (see Step 1)\n\nAt this point, the application is functional: the zone should display the templates, according to the configuration tree.\n3) Insert a configurator\nThe configurator is a component from the UI Builder library which is displayed when the user clicks on a component to configure it. It can display several built-in forms as well as (optional) custom forms corresponding to each of your templates.\nLike for the zones, the custom configurators are passed by transclusion.\n\n    \n    \n        \n        Currency\n        \n            Euro\n            Dollar\n        \n    \n\nFeatures\nState management\nConfiguration is at the heart of the UI Builder: It defines which components are displayed, their visual layout and which parameters they use.\nConfiguration is managed in a reactive store based on Elf (itself based on RxJS). Elf includes a state history which powers Undo/Redo buttons. Therefore, every action on the configuration (moving a component with drag & drop, creating a new component, or modifying its parameters) is undoable.\n\nAny change to the configuration is immediately visible in the UI, giving users a \"what you see is what you get experience\" (Wysiwyg).\nConfiguration can be easily synced with a server so that users always retrieve the application in the state they left it.\nHierarchical containers\nA container is a built-in type of component that displays sub-components (whose ids are listed in the items property):\n{\n    id: 'products',\n    type: '_container',\n    items: ['name', 'description', 'image', 'price']\n}Containers can contain other containers, which can contain other containers, and so on. This allows to create abritrarily complex layouts, with rows nested into columns, nested into rows, etc.\n\nConfiguration tree\nThe configuration tree can be used to visualize the configuration of each components. It represents the hierarchy of components within containers, within containers (etc.), within each zone.\nIt also allows to see the location of a component and select it directly, rather than having to look for it in the UI.\n\nDrag & drop\nComponents can be dragged and dropped intuitively within their zone. A component can be moved within its container, or within a different container.\nDrag & drop can also be used to drag new components in from a palette, or for removing a component from its zone.\nDrag & Drop is powered by the ngx-drag-drop library.\nComponent palettes\nPalettes of components are generated automatically based on the templates available to a zone. If a zone has 3 templates, then the palette will let you drag & drop any of those 3 templates anywhere into the zone, multiple times if needed.\nAdditionally, the palette lets users drag & drop new containers into existing containers.\nWhen a template has a custom configurator, this configurator is displayed in a modal prior to insertion, so that the user can initialize its configuration properly.\n\nForm templates\nComponents can have completely custom templates. These templates are passed by transclusion to the uib-configurator component, and are displayed when the user selects the component with a click, directly in the UI, or from the configuration tree.\nSimply pass a configurator template with the same name as the component template (in this case, \"foo\"):\n\n    \n    \n        Hello world\n        Lorem Ipsum...\n    \n\n\n...\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        Show text\n    \nCustom layouts\nContainers use CSS flexbox to display inner elements with a wide range of options (direction, alignment, wrapping, etc.)\nContainers have a built-in configurator for configuring these flexbox property visually.\n\nConditional display\nSometimes a component should be displayed only in certain conditions. In a normal Angular application, one can simply use *ngIf to define these conditions.\nWith the UI Builder, users can configure conditions by using the \"Conditional display\" form:\n\nIn the above form:\n\n\"Data\" corresponds to the [data] input passed to the  component. It is possible to pass additional objects to a zone via [conditionsData].\n\"Field\" corresponds to the field name of the data object.\n\"Type\" can be \"equals\", or \"regular expression\", for more complex use cases\n\"Values\" lists all the values that the condition should verify. \"Not\" allows to negate the condition, and \"Display if any of the conditions is true\" allows to switch between \"AND\" and \"OR\" when there are multiple values.\n\nStyle encapsulation\nThe library is dependent on Bootstrap for the styling of its components (configurator, toolbar, built-in forms).\nHowever Bootstrap does not have to be loaded globally in the host application (as it may conflict with another styling framework). Instead, we encapsulate the Bootstrap CSS within a .uib-bootstrap selector.\nThis means the library can be integrated in the host application with the following pattern:\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n\n        ...\n\n    \nHowever, the host application still requires some additional styling and utilities to correctly display the dynamic components within a .\nThese styles can be integrated with the following lines:\n@import \"~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-utilities.min\";\n@import \"~ngx-ui-builder/styles/ui-builder\";(Obviously, the first line can be ommited if you already use Bootstrap in your host application)\nStatic export\nCustomizing applications with UI Builder comes at a cost:\n\nThe source code of the application becomes more complex\nThe application becomes slower, as a result of being completely dynamic (templates are displayed as a result of a changing configuration)\n\nSo, at some point, it may be desirable to take the configuration and \"convert it\" into a normal, static, Angular application.\nThis can be achieved with one line of Angular CLI:\nng generate ngx-ui-builder:make-static -- --config=my-config.jsonThe make-static schematic takes as an input a JSON file containing the configuration of your application and generates HTML template(s) with the right templates in the right positions and with the right parameters passed as inputs. It also takes care of removing the ,  and  components from your app, as well as the import of the ui-builder stylesheet.\nAfter running this script, the app should compile and display your components exactly the same as before, but without a trace of the UI Builder in them anymore!\nInternationalization\nThe library has standard Angular i18n support.\nRunning ng extract-i18n for an application using ngx-ui-builder will extract all the strings marked for translation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2021 Sinequa\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
